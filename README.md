# Developer Zone Blog 
This repository contains files associated with the [Developer Zone](https://blogs.mathworks.com/developer/) blog.

Each blog post is a branch of this repository. Each branch contains content 
relevant to the blog post and is included for readers to reproduce the 
content of each post. You can clone an individual branch without fetching all 
branches with the following command in your shell:

```
git clone -b <branchname> --single-branch https://github.com/mathworks/developer-zone-blog
```
For example:

```
git clone -b 20205-Advanced-CI-Examples --single-branch https://github.com/mathworks/developer-zone-blog
```

Alternatively, you can simply clone the entire repository and use the branch
manager in MATLAB to switch to the preferred blog post.

Note that not every blog post has a branch here.
